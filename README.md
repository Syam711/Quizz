# Future Improvements
## User Accounts (Email + Password)

A full authentication system is planned, allowing users to create accounts, sign in securely, and keep their preferences intact across sessions. This will make the experience more personal and allow users to return to their work at any time.

## Quiz History

After accounts are introduced, users will be able to view all their past quizzes in one place. The history section will include topics, scores, difficulty levels, and the option to re-open or re-attempt previous quizzes. It’s intended to give learners a clear record of their progress.
